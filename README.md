# Atom-setup
A collection of my preferred packages for Atom.

## Theme
UI Theme: Atom Material  
Syntax Theme: Atom Material Dark

`file-icons` to display nice icons in the tree view and tabs  
`minimap` to have a preview of the full source code  
`atom-beautify` to beautify most extensions (Cmd+Option+B)  
`pigments` to automatically show colors of hex color codes  
`autocomplete-paths` to autocomplete paths for imports (add `node_modules` to `core.ignoredNames` to prevent file limit error)
